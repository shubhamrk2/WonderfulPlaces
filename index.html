            <h3>Banff National Park, Canada</h3>
            <p>Easily one of the most beautiful spots in Canada, Banff National Park overwhelms with views of the Canadian Rockies and a regular cast of wildlife. The park is also known for its abundance of beautiful lakes, including Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, and glacial Lake Minnewanka—each more pristine than the last.</p>
          </div>
          <img src="images/2_boulders.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Boulders Beach, South Africa</h3>
            <p>Located on the False Bay Coastline, about 17 miles south of Table Mountain, Boulders Beach shows off the famously beautiful landscapes of Cape Town (one of the most beautiful cities in the world)—bright blue water, granite boulders, and even penguins. Many people swim here just a few feet away from the adorable African penguin community, but feel free to just sit back and admire the beautiful coastline as well.</p>

          <img src="images/3_cappadocia.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Cappadocia, Turkey</h3>
            <p>Cappadocia, an area in Turkey where entire cities have been carved into rock, is pretty incredible on its own. But whenever hot-air balloons pepper the sky—with many floating up starting at sunrise—its beauty level literally skyrockets.</p>
          </div>
          <img src="images/4_denali.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Denali National Park, Alaska</h3>
            <p>Despite controversies over name changes and a shrinking elevation, Denali's beauty is worth braving the extreme low temperatures. Make a road trip out of your visit, seeing as much of the 6 million acres of shimmering lakes and jagged mountains as you can.</p>
          </div>
          <img src="images/5_galapogas.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Galápagos Islands, Ecuador</h3>
            <p>Do we really have to explain the allure of the Galápagos? If you can, make your next travel goal to visit this of-another-time stretch of Ecuador, with dinosaur-like giant tortoises lumbering through the tall grass and real-life blue-footed boobies.</p>
          </div>
          <img src="images/6_halong.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Halong Bay, Vietnam</h3>
            <p>Halong Bay, located in northeast Vietnam, is beloved for its blue waters and spread of limestone islands, all occupied by tropical trees and wildlife. Board a Chinese junk boat to experience the beauty—and associated myths and stories—of the mist-shrouded emerald basin for yourself.</p>

          <img src="images/7_mountfuji.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Mount Fuji, Japan</h3>
            <p>It's hard to pick the single most beautiful place in Japan, but 12,388-foot Mount Fuji just might take the prize. Visit Lake Kawaguchiko in the spring for some of the best views of the mountain and cherry blossom trees—a postcard-worthy sight if we ever saw one. Or if you're an avid hiker, plan a trip for mid-July until the end of August, when the snow melts enough to allow access to Fuji's summit.</p>

          <img src="images/8_kilimanjaro.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania</h3>
            <p>Africa's highest peak seems more striking than a lot of other famous mountains, because it's an ancient stratovolcano that's not part of any mountain range. That means the 19,000-foot summit drops down to vast, flat plains on all sides, making it a mirage-like blip on Tanzania's widespread topography. As an added bonus, the peak requires no technical mountaineering skills to summit, so even novice hikers can cross this item off their bucket lists.</p>

          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia</h3>
            <p>If you can make it through the crowds of selfie-taking tourists, you'll discover that Plitvice Lakes National Park more than lives up to the hype. The 16 terraced lakes of Croatia's most popular site are connected by waterfalls and vary in shades of blue, creating an infinitely dazzling result</p>

          <img src="images/10_serengeti.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Serengeti National Park, Tanzania</h3>
            <p>Tanzania's portion of the Serengeti is the ideal location for an African adventure. Visit between January and March to witness the wonder that is the Great Migration, an iconic phenomenon that sees 1.5 million wildebeest sweep through East Africa on an annual, 1,200-mile cycle.</p>

          <img src="images/11_svalbard.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Svalbard, Norway</h3>
            <p>Svalbard, the northern archipelago off the coast of Norway, is known for spectacular Northern Lights viewing opportunities—the sky is pitch black all day and night October through February, due to its position within the Arctic Circle. Svalbard is also known for its wildlife, including polar bears and arctic foxes who live out their days among the deep fjords and sheets of ice.</p>

          <img src="images/12_ubud.jfif">
          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Ubud, Bali</h3>
            <p>As crowded as Ubud can get, the town is only minutes from dozens of quiant villages and peaceful countryside vistas. Rent a motorbike or bicycle at your hotel and get lost in the villages, tangerine groves, and rice paddies—kept alive by farmers who tend the terraces just as previous generations have done for millennia.</p>

          <div class="caption">
            <h3>Taj Mahal, Agra, India</h3>
            <p>If there was just one symbol to represent all of India, it would be the Taj Mahal. The monument inspires millions of tourists to make the trip to Agra every year, waking up before dawn to see magnificent structure radiate at sunrise. But Agra tops the list of the best places to visit in India for reasons that go beyond India's most famous attraction.</p>

            <h3>Ajanta and Ellora Caves, Maharashtra, India</h3>
            <p>Time travel isn't a reality for travelers quite yet, but you can get pretty close at the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Maharashtra. Both UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the caves feature intricate carvings from at least 1,500 years ago. The Ajanta Caves are the oldest of the two attractions, featuring around 30 Buddhist cave monuments cut into the rock as far back as the 2nd century BC. Around 100 kilometers southwest, the Ellora Caves contain nearly three dozen Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu carvings, the most famous of which is the Kailasa Temple (Cave 16), a massive structure devoted to Lord Shiva that features life-size elephant sculptures.</p>

            <h3>Darjeeling, India</h3>
            <p>Sightseeing in India doesn't get much better than what you'll discover in Darjeeling. The hill station in West Bengal is beloved for its lush green tea plantations, awe-inspiring snow-capped peaks (including Khangchendzonga, the world's third-highest mountain), and serene Buddhist monasteries. This is the perfect place to arrange a mountain trek or mountain biking adventure.</p>
